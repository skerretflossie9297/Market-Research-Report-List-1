<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardiac Pacemakers</li><li>External Cardiac Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac pacemakers market is divided into two main types: implantable cardiac pacemakers and external cardiac pacemakers. Implantable cardiac pacemakers are surgically placed within the body to regulate heart rhythms, offering long-term solutions for patients with chronic arrhythmias. In contrast, external cardiac pacemakers are used temporarily, often in emergency situations or for monitoring, to provide immediate heart rate support without surgical intervention. Both types are essential for managing various cardiac conditions and enhancing patient quality of life.</p></p>
