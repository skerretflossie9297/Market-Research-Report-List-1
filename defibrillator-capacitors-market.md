<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillator Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monophasic Defibrillator Capacitor</li><li>Biphasic Defibrillator Capacitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The defibrillator capacitors market is primarily divided into two types: monophasic and biphasic defibrillator capacitors. Monophasic capacitors deliver a single shock waveform to the heart, traditionally used in older defibrillators, and are effective but have limitations in efficacy. In contrast, biphasic capacitors provide a waveform that travels in two directions, improving the chances of successful defibrillation and reducing myocardial cell damage. This has made biphasic capacitors the preferred choice in modern defibrillators, enhancing patient outcomes.</p></p>
