<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone Cement Fixation Prosthesis</li><li>Biological Fixation Prosthesis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The knee prosthesis market is primarily divided into two types: bone cement fixation prosthesis and biological fixation prosthesis. Bone cement fixation uses polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement to secure the prosthesis to the bone, providing immediate stability and support. In contrast, biological fixation relies on biological processes, allowing the prosthesis to integrate directly with the natural bone over time, promoting long-term stability without cement. Each type serves distinct patient needs and surgical approaches, influencing their application in knee replacement procedures.</p></p>
